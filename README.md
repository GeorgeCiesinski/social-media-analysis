# social-media-analysis

social-media-analysis is an educational project being built by a few interested team members to better their understanding of: 

* sentiment analysis
* web scraping
* database
* collaborative processes

social-media-analysis will collect data by scraping posts on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. It will analyze these posts, and the comments, and will store the data in a database for later analysis. We are exploring the kinds of data we can extract, and what we can extrapolate from this data. 

Not all of us are trained in Data Science, so this will be an explorative look at this field. We will probably do many things wrong, but this will help us learn from our mistakes and do it correctly next time.
